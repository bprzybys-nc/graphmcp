# Feature Request Template

This template provides a structured way to request new features for the GraphMCP framework using context engineering principles.

## Instructions

1. **Fill out this template completely** - The more detailed and specific you are, the better the implementation will be
2. **Reference existing patterns** - Look at `examples/` directory for similar implementations
3. **Use the context engineering workflow** - Follow the `/research` → `/prp` → `/implement` → `/validate` process

- **Timeline Risk**: Upgrade may take longer than expected

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing in development and staging environments
- **Phased Rollout**: Gradual rollout starting with development environments
- **Fallback Plan**: Maintain ability to rollback to Python 3.11 if issues arise
- **Dependency Audit**: Early audit of all dependencies for Python 3.12 compatibility
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of performance before and after upgrade

### Additional Context

#### Research Findings
- Python 3.12 introduces significant performance improvements through adaptive bytecode specialization
- Enhanced error messages provide better debugging experience for async code
- Improved type system with better generic type support benefits GraphMCP's type-heavy codebase
- Most major Python packages already support Python 3.12
- Python 3.12 is the current stable release with long-term support

#### Stakeholder Input
- Development team: Excited about performance improvements and better error messages
- DevOps team: Concerns about deployment complexity, but willing to support upgrade
- QA team: Requests comprehensive testing strategy to ensure no regressions
- Infrastructure team: Needs advance notice for environment preparation

#### Alternative Approaches
- **Stay on Python 3.11**: Minimal effort but misses performance and feature benefits
- **Wait for Python 3.13**: Avoids being early adopter but delays benefits
- **Gradual Migration**: Migrate components individually (complex due to shared dependencies)
- **Dual Version Support**: Support both 3.11 and 3.12 (adds complexity and maintenance burden)

## Example Feature Request

Here's an example of a well-structured feature request:

### Basic Information
- **Feature Name**: Redis Cache Integration
- **Requested By**: Development Team
- **Date**: 2024-01-15

- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium

### Feature Description

#### What
Add Redis caching support to the GraphMCP framework to improve performance of frequently accessed data such as MCP client configurations, workflow results, and repository analysis cache.

#### Why
Current workflow executions repeatedly fetch the same data from MCP servers, causing unnecessary latency and resource usage. Redis caching would:
- Reduce MCP server load by 60-80%
- Improve workflow execution time by 30-50%
- Provide better user experience with faster response times
- Enable offline development and testing scenarios

#### When
- **MVP**: End of Q1 2024
- **Full Implementation**: End of Q2 2024
- **Dependencies**: Redis server infrastructure setup

#### Who
- **Primary Users**: GraphMCP framework developers

- As a developer, I want MCP configurations to be cached so that client initialization is faster
- As a workflow user, I want faster response times so that I can iterate more quickly
- As a DevOps engineer, I want cache monitoring so that I can track performance improvements

#### Success Criteria
- Workflow execution time reduced by 30% for cached scenarios
- MCP client initialization time reduced by 50%
- Cache hit rate above 70% for typical usage patterns
- No functional regressions in existing workflows

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture Integration
