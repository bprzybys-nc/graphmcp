## Example Feature Request

Here's an example of a well-structured feature request:

### Basic Information
- **Feature Name**: Redis Cache Integration
- **Requested By**: Development Team
- **Date**: 2024-01-15
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium

### Feature Description

#### What
Add Redis caching support to the GraphMCP framework to improve performance of frequently accessed data such as MCP client configurations, workflow results, and repository analysis cache.

#### Why
Current workflow executions repeatedly fetch the same data from MCP servers, causing unnecessary latency and resource usage. Redis caching would:
- Reduce MCP server load by 60-80%
- Improve workflow execution time by 30-50%
- Provide better user experience with faster response times
- Enable offline development and testing scenarios

#### When
- **MVP**: End of Q1 2024
- **Full Implementation**: End of Q2 2024
- **Dependencies**: Redis server infrastructure setup

#### Who
- **Primary Users**: GraphMCP framework developers
- **Secondary Users**: Workflow users (indirect benefit)
- **Stakeholders**: DevOps team (infrastructure), QA team (testing)

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Functionality
- Cache MCP client configurations with TTL
- Cache workflow execution results
- Cache repository analysis results
- Provide cache invalidation mechanisms
- Support distributed caching for multiple instances

#### User Stories
- As a developer, I want workflow results to be cached so that repeated executions are faster
- As a developer, I want MCP configurations to be cached so that client initialization is faster
- As a workflow user, I want faster response times so that I can iterate more quickly
- As a DevOps engineer, I want cache monitoring so that I can track performance improvements

#### Success Criteria
- Workflow execution time reduced by 30% for cached scenarios
- MCP client initialization time reduced by 50%
- Cache hit rate above 70% for typical usage patterns
- No functional regressions in existing workflows

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture Integration
- **Framework Component**: New `cache/` module with Redis client
- **MCP Clients**: Add caching layer to all MCP clients
- **Workflow Integration**: Cache workflow step results
- **Dependencies**: Redis server, redis-py library

#### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Cache operations < 10ms
- **Throughput**: Support 1000+ cache operations per second
- **Scalability**: Support cluster deployment
- **Resource Usage**: < 100MB memory overhead

This example shows the level of detail and specificity that leads to successful context engineering implementations.
