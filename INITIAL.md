# Feature Request Template

This template provides a structured way to request new features for the GraphMCP framework using context engineering principles.

## Instructions

1. **Fill out this template completely** - The more detailed and specific you are, the better the implementation will be
2. **Reference existing patterns** - Look at `examples/` directory for similar implementations
3. **Use the context engineering workflow** - Follow the `/research` → `/prp` → `/implement` → `/validate` process
4. **Be explicit and comprehensive** - Context engineering works best with complete information

## Feature Request

### Basic Information
- **Feature Name**: Concrete Directory Refactoring and Core Integration
- **Requested By**: Development Team
- **Date**: 2025-01-18
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Complexity**: High

### Feature Description

#### What
Comprehensive refactoring of the `concrete/` directory to clean up unused functionality, move unique capabilities to appropriate core framework locations, enhance existing core functionality with concrete improvements, and remove duplicated code while updating all references.

#### Why
Analysis revealed that **~80% of concrete/ functionality is unused** by the database decommissioning workflow, and **88% of used functionality could be generalized** for broader framework use. This refactoring will:
- **Remove ~1,400 lines of unused code** from the codebase

### Additional Context

#### Research Findings
- **80% of concrete/ functionality is unused** by database decommissioning workflow
- **88% of used functionality is generalizable** for broader framework use
- **4 unique capabilities** don't exist in core framework
- **3 enhancement opportunities** identified in core components

- **Development team**: Wants cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- **Framework architects**: Wants better separation of concerns
- **Workflow implementers**: Wants reusable components for new workflows
- **Database decommissioning users**: Wants functionality preserved

#### Alternative Approaches
- **Leave as-is**: Keep unused code (maintains current complexity)

- **Complete rewrite**: Start from scratch (too risky and time-consuming)
- **Minimal cleanup**: Remove only obvious unused code (misses optimization opportunities)

#### Expected Outcomes
- **Cleaner codebase**: Reduced complexity and improved maintainability
- **Better architecture**: Clear separation between core and specialized functionality
- **Reusable components**: Components available for other workflows
- **Improved performance**: Reduced memory usage and faster imports
- **Better developer experience**: Easier to understand and modify code
