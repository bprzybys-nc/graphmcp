### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For agents this looks like:
    - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic 
    - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent 
    - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.

### üîå GraphMCP-Specific Patterns
- **MCP Client Architecture**: Use abstract base classes with `SERVER_NAME` class attribute and async context manager support
- **Error Handling**: Use custom exception hierarchies (see `examples/mcp_base_client.py`)
- **Data Models**: Use `@dataclass` with type hints and pickle-safe serialization (see `examples/data_models.py`)
- **Configuration**: Load configs with environment variable substitution using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax
- **Testing**: Use `pytest-asyncio` with comprehensive test markers (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`)

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- **Dataclass Patterns**: Use `@dataclass` for data models with `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods
- **Async Patterns**: Use `async`/`await` for I/O operations, implement `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` for context managers
- **Configuration**: Use `.env` files with `python-dotenv` and environment variable substitution
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Build & Deployment
- **Use Makefile automation** for common tasks (see `examples/makefile_patterns.md`)
- **Comprehensive help system**: `make help` should show all available targets
- **Testing commands**: `make test`, `make test-unit`, `make test-integration`
- **Code quality**: `make lint`, `make format`, `make type-check`
- **Environment management**: `make venv`, `make install`, `make clean`
- **Docker support**: Include `make docker-build`, `make docker-run` targets

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
