# GraphMCP Project History

This document contains historical implementation notes and completed features for reference.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced Database Decommissioning (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Use DatabaseReferenceExtractor as replacement for search pattern step and FileDecommissionProcessor for pragmatic decommissioning strategy implementation.

**Implementation**: 
- ‚úÖ DatabaseReferenceExtractor replaces PatternDiscoveryEngine
- ‚úÖ FileDecommissionProcessor replaces ContextualRulesEngine  
- ‚úÖ Pragmatic decommissioning strategies (comment configs, remove infrastructure, add exceptions)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced workflow orchestration with PRP components
- ‚úÖ Directory-based processing with file extraction

### 2. Unified Dual-Sink Logging System (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Replace all 4 fragmented logging systems with single UnifiedLogger featuring dual-sink architecture, severity color coding, and independent threshold management.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Dual-sink logging (File-only structured + Visual UI) with independent thresholds
- ‚úÖ File Logging: Constant LOG_FILEPATH='dbworkflow.log' with rotating file handler
- ‚úÖ Severity Color Coding: DEBUG(gray), INFO(white), WARNING(orange), ERROR(red), CRITICAL(bold red)
- ‚úÖ Migration Strategy: Replaced all logging.getLogger() calls with structured logging
- ‚úÖ Threshold Management: Independent control over file sink and visual sink

### 3. Claude-Trace Structured Logging System (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: JSON-first logging approach following Claude Code patterns.

**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ StructuredLogger with JSON-first architecture
- ‚úÖ Dual-sink architecture (JSON + console)
- ‚úÖ LogEntry, StructuredData, and ProgressEntry models
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven logging with LoggingConfig
- ‚úÖ Independent threshold management for file and console outputs

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

The current system uses:
- **Modular structure**: `concrete/db_decommission/` with separate modules
- **Structured logging**: `graphmcp/logging/` with JSON-first approach
- **Workflow orchestration**: `workflows/builder.py` with step-based execution
- **MCP integration**: Multiple MCP clients for GitHub, Slack, Repomix, etc.

## üìö Migration Notes

- Legacy single-file implementations have been replaced with modular architecture
- All logging systems consolidated into `graphmcp/logging/`
- PRPs have been implemented and archived to `archive/completed-prps/`
- PRDs have been completed and archived to `archive/implemented/`
